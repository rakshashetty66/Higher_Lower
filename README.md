# Higher or Lower Game
1. This project is a simple Higher or Lower game built using Python, where the player guesses which celebrity or public figure has more followers on social media.
2. The game continues as long as the player's guess is correct, and their score increases with each correct answer.
3. When the player guesses incorrectly, the game ends and displays the final score.

# Key Features:
1. Uses random selections from a predefined list of popular accounts (contained in higher_lower_game.data).
2. Compares two accounts at a time and asks the player to guess which one has more followers.
3. A scoring system that tracks the number of correct guesses.
4. Displays information like the name, profession, and country of each account for comparison.
5. tilizes game assets (logos and vs graphic) from game_art.py.
6. Clears the console after each guess for a clean user experience.
